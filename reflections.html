  <h2> July 5th, 2017---Reflections on MVC Paradigm and Web Framework</h2>
  
  <p> Questions : "In your own words, what is the MVC Paradigm? How is it used?" <br>
    "What is the difference between a framework and a library?" <br>
    "Why might you use a framework instead of creating an app yourself?" <br><br>
    
    A MVC Paradigm is a pattern for relating user interface to data models and is divided into three parts. The difference between a 
    framework and a library is that a library is a set of functions used for one purpose, while a framework is a collection or set of those 
    libraries. I might use a framework instead of creating an app myself because it would be faster and more efficient because the framwork 
    already provides me a template to make an application, so that I won't have to start from scratch. </p>

  <h2> July 10th, 2017---Reflection on Data</h2>
  
  <p> Question 1 : "What makes computers good at data? <br>
    "Write an interesting fact about the data scientist you researched today."  <br><br>
  
  Computers are good at data because they can easily memorize a large amount of data. The data scientist that I researched today is Marina Martin. 
    One interesting fact about her is that she helps veterans by using data and computers.</p>
