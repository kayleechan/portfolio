    <h2 id="about">About</h2>
    <p style="color:white;" >Being born and raised in San Francisco has influenced me to think more about technology and its advancements. I am fortunate enough
      to live in a city where tech is thriving and going to continue to flourish over the course of many more years. <br> <br>During my sophomore year, 
      I decided to take on Girls Who Code. I began taking classes every Saturday from 10am-12pm at my local library to learn more about 
      coding and computer science. When the classes ended, I felt myself expressing interest in this field. I decided to apply to the Girls Who Code Summer 
      Immersion Program to spend my summer expanding my knowledge even more. I believe the summer program will equip me with many strong 
    resources needed to continue my journey in exploring computer science. </p>
